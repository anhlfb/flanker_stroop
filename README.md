# FlankerTest


In this project, I used PsychoPy to generate the code that tests both the Flanker test and the Stroop test. I used 3 trials of the Flanker test and 3 trials of the Stroop test which will be generated randomly. 

The Stroop task will start first, followed by a flanker task. 

The code will print a csv file at the end of each experiment with some important information such as: Participant ID, Block type, the answer from the participant, the correct answer to compare, RT 

To run the project, run the file main.py.
